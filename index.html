			<p>I have no idea why all the editor writers think that tabs which are basically invisible and are of varying variable size by personal preference are cool. When I used to work on and IBM PC running DOS 1 and I only had 2 360K floppy drives then a tab saved a bit of space sometimes. I personally like to indent with 2 spaces and I have been doing so for much more than 10 years. I did update User Settings in Preferences on Windows today and it seemed to work for me. I currently do not have that box up and running now, I still have to update my Linux system with this.</p><!--
